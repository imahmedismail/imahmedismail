# About Me

I'm a seasoned Software Engineer with a deep passion for developing scalable, reliable applications and designing robust architectures. With a solid background in software development and IT services, I excel in dynamic environments and am always eager to master new technologies. My career has seen me work on large-scale systems, particularly in audiovisual virtual environments, leveraging cutting-edge technologies.

## Expertise

My primary focus is on the Elixir/Phoenix ecosystem, where I've honed my skills in creating REST APIs, implementing GraphQL with Absinthe, working with WebSockets, and utilizing LiveViews. My approach to coding is rooted in concurrency, pattern-matching, and the effective use of third-party APIs, all while ensuring my code is clean and efficient.

In addition to my Elixir/Phoenix expertise, I have a strong foundation in PostgreSQL, cloud storage solutions like S3, and various other technologies. I am well-versed in both functional and object-oriented programming, and my technical toolkit includes Elixir/Erlang, Phoenix LiveViews, GraphQL/Absinthe, ExUnit for unit testing, and Wallaby for concurrent browser testing.

Beyond Elixir/Phoenix, I bring extensive experience with:

- **Backend Engineering:** Elixir, RoR, PHP/Laravel, Python, HTTP(s) protocol, RESTful APIs
- **Frontend Mastery:** TypeScript, VueJS, React, NextJS, Angular, ElectronJS, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, jQuery
